The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

For each category, the mean and standard deviation of each measurement group is averaged together for corresponding pairs of subject/activity (so there is 1 mean and 1 standard deviation presented for each subject performing each of the 6 activities for 180 rows).

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additionally, there are 3 other variables:
subID: the subject ID used to identify which subject the recorded data is from (runs 1 to 30)
Activ: numeric representation of the 6 activities used to make measurements. 1-6 corresponds to:        "Walking","Walking_Upstairs","Walking_Downstairs","Sitting","Standing","Laying"
actName: the character name of the activity used to make the measurement.
